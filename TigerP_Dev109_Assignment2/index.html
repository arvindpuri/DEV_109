  <p><h1>Seafood Paella Recipe</h1></p>

<p>
  Hi, This is Tiger.
</p>
  
<p>  
   Like many of you, I like seafood paella. 
</p>

<p>
   During the SARS-COV2 Pandemic, when many restaurants shut down, I learned to cook my favorite dishes at home. Seafood Paella is one of my favorite Spanish food recipes.

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Ingredients:</li>
      Roughly chop the garlic, dice the onion, and chop the bell pepper. Cut the squid into small squares.
      <li>Cook the Seafood:</li>
      In a large paella pan or deep skillet, heat about 1/3 cup of olive oil over medium-high heat.
      Add the squid and cook for about 1.5 to 2 minutes until slightly golden. Remove from the pan and set aside.
      In the same pan, add the diced onion and garlic; saut√© until translucent (about 3 minutes). Then add the bell pepper and cook for an additional minute.
      <li>Add Tomatoes and Spices:</li>
      Stir in the diced tomatoes, smoked paprika, sea salt, and black pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes until the mixture thickens.
      <li>Incorporate Rice and Broth:</li>
      Pour in the fish broth and add the saffron. Bring to a boil.
      Once boiling, add the rice, stirring to ensure it is evenly distributed. Do not stir again after this point.
      <li>Add Seafood:</li>
      After about 5 minutes of cooking, add the shrimp and mussels to the pan.
      Reduce heat to low-medium and let simmer until all liquid is absorbed (approximately another 10-15 minutes).
      <li>Create Socarrat:</li>
      To achieve socarrat (the crispy bottom layer), increase the heat to medium-high for an additional minute or two at the end of cooking.
      <li>Serve:</li>
      Remove from heat and cover with a clean kitchen towel for about 5 minutes.
      Garnish with lemon wedges and chopped parsley before serving.
    </ol>
  
  <p>This seafood paella is not only a feast for the eyes but also a delightful blend of flavors that brings a taste of Spain to your dining table. Enjoy!
